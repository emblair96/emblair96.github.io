# My portfolio

[My portfolio](https://emblair96.github.io/) in its most basic sense is a way to showcase my work as a software developer to potential employers.  More largely, it is a space to document my overall growth as an aspiring software engineer and share why I'm passionate about what I do.   

## What you'll find on my portfolio

* My approach to software development

* My level of familiarity with vairous programming languages

* Example projects I've worked on

* How to connect with me

## Credits

I would like to credit my Northwestern Bootcamp instructor, Lori Culberson, and the TAs for the course, Tony and Pat, for teaching me the skills necessary to start my porfolio.  

In addition, below are two sites I would like to credit for graphics, as well as an HTML validator resource:

* The graphic elements in my about section are from [Github's primer style](https://primer.style/octicons/).  

* I used [Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/social-media-icons) for the social media icons located in my footer.

* [This html validator](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html) is useful in verifying my code is valid and follows best practices.
